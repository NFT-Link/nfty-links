# Welcome to the [INSERT PROJECT NAME](https://unstoppable-portfolio.vercel.app/)!
This is a NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project where anyone can create a unique token and transfer it to others via the URL.
Usecases for this are:
- store owners giving NFTs to their customers,
- charity giving NFTs to people who donate. 
- send NFTs to a mailing list (each mail gets a unique url)
- import existing NFTs and package them into an url

This project uses:
- Frontend: Nextjs and React for the Frontend. We are using ethers.js for the wallet interaction.
- Backend: is made using java spring boot and offers great options for further extensions for this project
- Offchain Data is stored in a redis database.
- NFT metadata is stored on IPFS using nft.storage
- example project is deployed on rinkeby network, but all EVM chains are in the roadmap
